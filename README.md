# Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) with Stan using brute force marginalisation

This is a small collection of code for a first stab at implementing BSSVS ([George & McCulloch, (1993)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238727682_Variable_Selection_Via_Gibbs_Sampling), [George and McCulloch, 1995](https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=en&lr=&id=T2G1DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA203&dq=bayesian+stochastic+search+variable+selection+mccullough&ots=VtgXGStQzz&sig=ZTIm35SjchjiRPteJhxhwiXGE_8&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=bayesian%20stochastic%20search%20variable%20selection%20mccullough&f=false)) with Stan.

This code should **not**, for the time being, be considered correct in any way.

The ultimate goal is to show how one might go about implementing this framework in Stan for small dimensions, for didactic purposes.
